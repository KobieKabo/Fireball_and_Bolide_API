# **Fireball and Bolide Tracker**

## **Project Objective**
Sift through an abundance of positional and velocity data on fireball and bolide reportings documented by NASA. Build a Flask application for querying and returning information from the NASA data set.The included Dockerfile containerizes fireball_api.py to make it portable. ADD SOMETHING ABOUT KUBERNETES

**Data Collected From:**
https://data.nasa.gov/api/views/mc52-syum/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD

**ISS Data Description**

The data collected from the above link is generated by U.S. Government sensors and ground-based observers. Note that this data is is not meant to be a complete list of all fireball events. Only the brightest fireballs are noted. 

What is a fireball or bolide? A fireball is an unusually bright meteor that reaches a visual magnitude of -3 or brighter when seen at the observer's zenith. Objects causing fireball events can exceed one meter in size. Fireballs that explode in the atmosphere are technically referred to as bolides although the terms fireballs and bolides are often used interchangeably. 


	Distance - [km]
	Velocity - [km/s]
	Radiated Energy - [J]
	Impact Energy - [kT]

### **fireball_api.py Description:**

The fireball_api.py script initializes a Flask instance, loads data from the NASA API linked above, and stores the data in Redis. The flask application tracks the altitude, location and velocity of the bolides which given in latitudes/longitudes and Cartesian vectors for both position.This data along with a time stamp, and calculated radiated and impact energy describe the complete state of the documented fireballs and bolides.

#### **Dockerfile Description & Instructions**

How to pull and use the Dockerfule from Docker Hub:

	docker pull khanks0217/fireball_api:1.0

How to build a new image from Dockerfile:

	docker build -t username/fireball_api:1.0 .

Start the container in the foreground:

	docker-compose config

With the iss_tracker container running, curl in another window to interact with the program.

##### **Fireball API Front End:**

The API front end is expose on port 5000 inside the container. Try the following routes:


	$ curl -X POST localhost:5000/data	Load the entire data set into Redis.
	
	$ curl -X GET localhost:5000/data 	Returns a list of all data from Redis. 

	$ curl -X DELETE localhost:5000/data	Delete all of the data from Redis.

	$ curl localhost:5000/timestamp		Return all timestamps from Redis.

	$ curl localhost:5000/timestamp/<string: pr_date> 	Return all data for a specific timestamp.

	$ curl localhost:5000/timestamp/<string: pr_date>/speed 	Return velocity data for a specific timestamp.

	$ curl localhost:5000/timestamp/<string: pr_date>/energy 	Return energy data for a specific timestamp.

	$ curl localhost:5000/timestamp/<string: pr_date>/location 	Return positional data for a specific timestamp.


	$ curl localhost:5000/help	Returns help text (as a string) that briefly describes each route.
