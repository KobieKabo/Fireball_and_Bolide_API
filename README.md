# **Fireball and Bolide Tracker**

## **Project Objective**
Sift through an abundance of positional and velocity data on fireball and bolide reportings documented by NASA. Build a Flask application for querying and returning information from the NASA data set.The included Dockerfile containerizes fireball_api.py to make it portable. The Fireball and Bolide Tracker application is hosted on the Kubernetes cluster and accessible to the outside world at a unique, public URL listed below.

The front-end REST API has an abundance of endpoints to post, get, and delete data from Redis in addition to endpoints for submitting a job to plot data and retrieve the results. The back end workers use queue functionality to watch  for jobs being submitted by the user. Aditionally, the workers generate a plot and adds the image back to Redis such that the user can download it at will. 

**Data Collected From:**
https://data.nasa.gov/api/views/mc52-syum/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD

**Fireball and Bolide Data Description**

The data collected from the above link is generated by U.S. Government sensors and ground-based observers. Note that this data is is not meant to be a complete list of all fireball events. Only the brightest fireballs are noted. 

What is a fireball or bolide? A fireball is an unusually bright meteor that reaches a visual magnitude of -3 or brighter when seen at the observer's zenith. Objects causing fireball events can exceed one meter in size. Fireballs that explode in the atmosphere are technically referred to as bolides although the terms fireballs and bolides are often used interchangeably. 


	Distance - [km]
	Velocity - [km/s]
	Radiated Energy - [J]
	Impact Energy - [kT]
	*Data Description adapted from https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/fireball-and-bolide-reports* 

### **fireball_api.py Description:**

The fireball_api.py script initializes a Flask instance, loads data from the NASA API linked above, and stores the data in Redis. The flask application tracks the altitude, location and velocity of the bolides which given in latitudes/longitudes and Cartesian vectors for both position.This data along with a time stamp, and calculated radiated and impact energy describe the complete state of the documented fireballs and bolides.

#### **Dockerfile Description & Instructions**

How to pull and use the Dockerfule from Docker Hub:

	docker pull khanks0217/fireball_api:1.1

	docker pull khanks0217/fireball_api:1.wrk

How to build a new image from Dockerfile:

	Note: Be sure to include your username with the following commands.

	docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.api -t username/fireball_api:1.1

	docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.wrk -t username/fireball_api:1.wrk

#### **Instructions - How to use genes_api on Kubernetes**

Create a persistent volume claim (pvc)

	kubectl apply -f app-prod-db-pvc.yml

Deploy redis on the kubernetes cluster

	kubectl apply -f app-prod-db-deployment.yml


Deploy redis service on kubernetes cluster

	kubectl apply -f app-prod-db-service.yml

Add the redis IP address to the app-prod-api-deployment.yml

	kubectl get services

	Copy app-test-service IP address to the REDIS_IP value in the api deployment file.

Create a flask deployment:

	kubectl apply -f app-prod-api-deployment.yml

Create a flask service:

	kubectl apply -f app-prod-api-service.yml

Create a worker deployment:

	kubectl apply -f app-prod-wrk-deployment.yml

Create a NodePort:

	kubectl apply -f app-prod-api-nodeport.yml

Copy the nodeport port to app-prod-api-ingress.yml

	kubectl get services

	NAME                         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
	flasktest-service-nodeport   NodePort    10.233.15.48   <none>        5000:31587/TCP   45s

	Edit app-prod-api-ingress.yml 
	host: "username.coe332.tacc.cloud" <-- This should be your username
	...
	port:
	  number: 31587   <--This should be the same as the port from NodePort 5000:/XXXXX

Create the Ingress object:

	kubectl apply -f app-prod-api-ingress.yml

	kubectl get ingress

	NAME                CLASS    HOSTS                       ADDRESS   PORTS   AGE
	flasktest-ingress   <none>   username.coe332.tacc.cloud             80      102s

We can test by running the following curl command from anywhere, including our laptops.

	curl -X POST username.coe332.tacc.cloud/data
